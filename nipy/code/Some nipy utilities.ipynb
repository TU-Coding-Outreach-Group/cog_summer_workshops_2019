    "> I like using python and jupyter notebooks because they end up being easy for me and help me keep things organized. If you find that the logic for how objects work, or documentation doesn't  help you don't feel pressured to use these tools. However I wanted to use this workshop to introduce these tools so that with a little bit of work we can have the same ease of use for these things.\n",
